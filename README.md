**CTIS 2022-2023 Senior Project**

**Project Description:** Donut share is a web-based discussion platform that allows people to anonymously debate with other people and evaluate the arguments used in other similar discussions. Every day, a unique proposition will be provided to the debaters by the moderators, and the debaters will choose to agree or disagree with the proposition. The system will match the debater with another debater, who has selected the other option. Then the two debaters will start to debate over the proposition by stating their arguments. The arguments used during the debate will be posted to a dashboard along with the explanation of the convinced debater, so that other users can review the arguments being used and vote for them.
